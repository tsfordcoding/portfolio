            Who am I?
            Where am I located? -->
          
          <p>My name is Timothy Ford, but you can call me Tim. I am currently learning to become a
            software developer. I am located in the vicinity of Los Angeles, California. I currently 
            live in Palmdale, California with my wife and son. In the meantime, I work as a Substitute
            Teacher while I am a student at Thinkful.
          </p>

          <p>As a prospective software developer, I am currently interested in learning about the 
            following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Full Stack Web Development - MEAN Stack</li>
            <li>Full Stack Web Development - MERN Stack</li>
            <li>Full Stack Web Development - MEVN Stack</li>
            <li>Game Design</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>About Tim</h3>

          <!-- About Me 
            A description that shows your passion for web development and your willingness to work 
            with others.
            One or two sentences that describe other interests you have outside of web development-->

          <p>In college, it was my original intent to graduate with a degree in Computer Science, but
            I eventually graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Linguistics. This led me to become interested
            in teaching for a time. Both of my parents were teachers, and I wanted to see if it was something
            I would like to pursue a career in as well. I have been a Substitute Teacher for about five and a
            half years. Even though I have gotten the wonderful opportunity to work with many teachers while
            working as a Long Term Substitute Teacher, I have found that teaching does not really fit as a career
            for me anymore. Therefore, I began pursuing my interest in Computer Science and Web Development again.
            I have always found working with code fascinating and a lot of fun. I really love the process of 
            creating websites. That is why I have completed an Associate of Science in Web Development, and I am
            further learning the skills necessary to become a Full Stack Developer at Thinkful. I am excited to
            start a career working on a web development team.
          </p>

          <p>As a hobby, I spend a lot of time with my wife and son going shopping at the store and
            we love to go to Universal Studios Hollywood. I am also an avid gamer. I own all three
            systems, Nintendo Switch OLED, Playstation 5, and XBox Series X. I am currently working
            on making it through FROM SOFTWARE titles Elden Ring and Bloodborne.
